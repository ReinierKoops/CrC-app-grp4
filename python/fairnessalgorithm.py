    In this strategy, one person chooses first,
    then another, until everyone has made one choice. The next rounds
    usually begin with the one who had to choose last in the previous
    round. However, if the userâ€™s top two preferences have already been
    selected in that round we go on to the next person. It continues
    until all items are consumed.

# FAIRNESS Aggregation takes each group member in turn and add to the group recommendation list the candidate item
# (from those which have not yet been inserted into the group recommendation list) for which the rating of the user is
# highest. Then, for each group member, it chooses a second item, starting with the group member who chose the last item
# in the previous round. It repeats this until it has chosen N (e.g., 5) items.
